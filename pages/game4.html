        Game:<br>
        <br>
        This is Bullet Box 1.0. A game where you have to survive incoming bullets and 
        falling boxes. You main aim is to collect boxes and shoot them to their 
        rightful landing pads. Beware though if you have no boxes in you inventory 
        your health bar decreases and if you do have boxes your health decreases but 
        at a faster pace. So the health bar is unstable thus this game was made for the 2025 
        Bullet hell
